# Retail-store-bill-discounts
This project implements different kinds of discounts for small retail website.

# Assumption Made:
	1.Mutually exclusive discounts are applied first.
	i.e. discounts related to whether, user is Employee,Affiliate or Customer since more than two years.
	
	2.As per assigment,Since we are talking about discounts on entire bill.
	Therefore to make case very simple ,I have assummed entire bill to be of one category.
	3.While applying multiple discounts,Lets say for two discounts ,the second discount is applied on discounted amount.
	4.The current system can enhanced to add more details in the system. like adding Product and product related data.
